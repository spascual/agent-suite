## Objective
Plan to write an .md file with instructions for a Python library research agent.
### Persona
It must instruct the research agent to identify relevant use cases for the Python library through the persona of a forward deployed engineer working on AI-agents and managing the full development lifecycle of agentic applications.
### Requirements
 1. The file structure (.md header, headings, highlights, capitalisation, file length, instructure formatting, etc.) should mimic the one in@claude-instructions/agents/codebase-analyzer.md
 2. It must instruct the agent to provide:
	 - Relevant code snippet examples of syntactic sugar of the Python library, and 
	 - Produce quick 5 minute review summaries of the library including purpose, use cases, and relevant application fitting the persona.
### Formatting
It must reference the library and its url to their docs as a placeholders for the agent to use.
