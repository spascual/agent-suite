## CLI

- `rg` (ripgrep): Fast grep searches for file system navigation

## Plans

- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any.

## Python

- For Python conventions, see ~/.claude/skills/python-style-guide.md
- For existing codebase documentation, see ~/.claude/skills/codebase-snapshot.md
