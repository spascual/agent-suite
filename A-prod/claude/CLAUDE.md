## CLI

- `rg` (ripgrep): Fast grep searches for file system navigation
- For Python conventions, see ~/.claude/skills/python-style-guide.md

## Plans

- Make the plan extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any.
