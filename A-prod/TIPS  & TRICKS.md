### Practical insight

Claude Code uses `CLAUDE.md` , not `AGENTS.md`.
Using symlink between them to keep all your tools working the same way:

`$ ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md`

### Frontend development

- For gestures, components, etc. use iOs UIkit (over iOS Swift)
- For inspiration on layouts, design patterns and components, check out Mobbin
- For beta testing an iOS app, Test Flight

### AWS

- Install and configure AWS CLI, and reference it in `CLAUDE.md`
  - Example application: Create a functioning AWS Cloudwatch dashboard

### Fast Product Iteration

- Ideation: Identify underserved painpoints/problems in your daily life. LIVE AN INTERESTING LIFE.
- Ship first, ship fast: Get started, lower your bar. Even a new crafted workflow or design can attract customers.
- Checklist before launch: Waitlist page, feedback collection workflow, analytics integration (PostHog), and build a community in Reddit by participating in your underserved niche.
